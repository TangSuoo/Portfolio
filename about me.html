       <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>  There's not much about me. Where do I even start? Well, first off, I'm Jessica and this is the beginning
             of my journey into coding. Actually... that's not right. I sort of started back in 2012 when I didn't know what to major in.
             I kept jumping into different fields like Culinary, Accounting, some kind of Art, graphic design and then web design.
             After a while, I guess you can say I took a vacation from college and never went back! Here I am, years later trying to get back into it.

        </p>

        <p>   I also dipped my toes into blender, illustration art, and drawing for fun but never stuck to it. Although, I may go back to blender.
             Anyway, forget about the learning stuff. These days, I'm really into playing Party Animal! Its fun, silly and just plain chaotic. You should definitely
             check it out.. at the cost of $20! If im not playing games, then I'm watching kdrama. You can check out my top 3 list by clicking
